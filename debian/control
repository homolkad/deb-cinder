Description: OpenStack block storage system - Python libraries
 Cinder is a block Storage-as-a-Service system for the OpenStack cloud
 computing suite. It re-implements the features of Nova-volume, which it
 directly replaces.
 .
 Cinder uses LVM partitions of your volume servers in order to provide iSCSI
 permanent block storage devices for your virtual machines running on Nova.
 It also has back-end drivers for many hardware and software storage solutions
 like Ceph, NFS, Net-APP, etc.
 .
 This package contains the Python libraries that are part of Cinder.
