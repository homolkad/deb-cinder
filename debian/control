Description: Openstack block storage as a service - Python libraries
 Cinder is a block storage as service system for the Openstack cloud computing
 software suite. It is a direct replacement for nova-volume as a separate
 project. Cinder users LVM partitions of your volume servers in order to
 provide iSCSI permanent block storage devices for your virtual machines
 running on Nova.
 .
 This package contains the Python libraries that are parts of cinder.
